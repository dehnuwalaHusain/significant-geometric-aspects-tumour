# Significant Geometric Aspects of Tumour

A team of scientists has collected data for studying tumor types (benign vs malignant) for cancer.
The team has analyzed tumors for different geometrical aspects such as mean radius of tumor,
mean texture of tumor, area of the tumor, etc. for both types of tumors benign (denoted as B) and
malignant (denoted as M). Now, the team would like to know what significant geometrical aspects
of the tumor which allow them to distinguish benign and malignant tumors in the future. Use
different descriptive statistics and plots for answering the question. Also, use the plots to visualize
if the variables are highly correlated and report the correlation coefficients for those variables. The
data set to be used here is Cancergeometry.csv.
